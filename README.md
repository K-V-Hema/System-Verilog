# System-Verilog

**Overview**

This repository contains a curated collection of SystemVerilog modules, testbenches, and verification examples intended for digital design and hardware verification learning and reference.

**What’s Inside**

The repository includes components and examples in the following categories:

Basic SystemVerilog modules (data types, arrays, structures, interfaces)

Verification constructs (testbenches, assertions, coverage)

RTL and design modules illustrating synthesis-friendly constructs

Language feature demonstrations (tasks/functions, OOP, randomization, interfaces)

Small design projects/tutorials to use as templates or learning aids
